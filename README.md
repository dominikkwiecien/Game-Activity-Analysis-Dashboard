## Project Overview

This Tableau project was created to analyze game activity data, focusing on key metrics such as user engagement, playtime, and demographic insights. The project consists of three distinct sheets combined into a comprehensive dashboard, offering an in-depth view of user behavior across different time periods and demographic groups.

### Objective

The primary goal of this project was to visualize and analyze game user activity data. The following tasks were accomplished:

1. **Total User Count and Battle Pass Engagement**: Tracked the monthly trends in the total number of game users and the percentage of users engaged in "Battle Pass" activities.
2. **Average Playtime Analysis**: Calculated and visualized the average playtime per user, including detailed time labels in hours and minutes.
3. **Heatmap of User Engagement by Age Group**: Created a heatmap to depict the distribution of users across different age groups and their engagement over quarterly timeframes.

### Dashboard Description

The final dashboard is an interactive tool that provides comprehensive insights into game activity data. It is composed of the following sections:

- **Trends in Total Number of Users and Battle Pass Ratio Over Time**: 
  - This line chart displays the month-over-month changes in the total number of users and the ratio of users participating in Battle Pass activities.
  
- **Monthly Average Total Playtime by Game**: 
  - A bar chart showing the average total playtime (in seconds) per user for each game, broken down by month. Playtime is labeled in a "HH:MM" format to give a clear understanding of user engagement.
  
- **User Distribution by Age Range and Quarterly Activity**:
  - A heatmap that visualizes the number of users in different age ranges over each quarter of the year. The size and intensity of the squares represent the total number of users within each age group.

### Filters

To enhance the interactivity of the dashboard, several filters were added:

- **Activity Date**: Filter data based on the specific month or quarter of interest.
- **Age Range**: Narrow down the data to specific age groups to focus on demographic trends.
- **Game Name**: Filter by specific games to analyze user engagement on a per-game basis.
- **Language**: Filter data based on the user's device language settings.
